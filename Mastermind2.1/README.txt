 Mastermind is a two-player code-breaking game where one player makes a code (in your program this will be the human player) and another player guesses the code (in your program this will be the computer player). Your task is to create a game that allows a human to play against the computer. The computer should be able to guess the correct code (created by the human player) within 10 turns. The code is made up of four colors and can include duplicates. There are six available colors from which to choose: red, green, orange, yellow, blue, purple.
